## ðŸ“˜ BlogVerseDB

BlogVerseDB is a SQL Server database designed for a blogging platform.  
It follows normalization principles and includes key database concepts such as:



- **Stored Procedures** for user registration, post creation, and comments.
- **User-Defined Functions** (e.g., `fn_CountPostsByUser`) to calculate user statistics.
- **Transactions** to ensure atomic operations (e.g., create post + comment).
- **Indexes** on key columns to improve query performance.
- **Execution Plans** analysis for query optimization and efficiency.

This project demonstrates clean database design, performance tuning, and best practices in SQL Server development.
